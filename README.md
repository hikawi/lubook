## Description

This is **not** a production commercial application. This was created just because I hate my group's version of this project. When they suggested building a website where you can read mangas, I envisioned it to be akin to other sharing communities like Archive of Our Own, Wattpad, etc., but their idea is more about a pirating, stealing and reposting mangas, which I do not support.

I don't have any problems with piracy for personal usage, but this situation is within an educational environment, as a project for a Software Engineering course, which is the reason why I find it to be wrong. I have brought up this issues with the group, as an artist myself, I would not be comfortable working on such a project, it is mind boggling how completely normal they feel about stealing works, so I gave up on persuading them and created my own version of said project. I made this project to prove that this can be done, without the need to steal other people's works.

The architectural design is courtesy of the group manager as he decided on the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. Except that, this uses Astro's file-based routing for API routes, and does not depend on Express servers. The design is courtesy of me, so no credits needed.
